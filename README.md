# Logistics_Regression

## Definition
> Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used for binary classification problems. Instead of predicting a continuous outcome (as in linear regression), logistic regression predicts the probability of an observation belonging to one of two classes.
>
> It is used to predict a categorical dependent variable from a number of independent variables

## Sigmoid Curve
It uses Sigmoid curve to output probability figures.

### Sigmoid Curve and Prediction of New Observations
> The sigmoid curve is a key component of logistic regression, used to model the relationship between input features and the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class. Its "S-shape" ensures that predictions are mapped to a probability range between 0 and 1.
